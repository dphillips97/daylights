# daylights

**Description**

This notebook shows a heatmap of days of the year (2019), color coded by day length. Daylight hours per day was obtained from [US Naval Observatory](https://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/Dur_OneYear.php). I visualized absolute time of daylight, percent of maximum daylight that any day gets vs. summer solstice, and std between days in each month (to see which month has the largest spread of daylight times)

**Goal**

I wanted to continue learning to use Pandas with real-world data. I also wanted to practive data visualization with different graphing styles - in this case, a heatmap

**Future directions**

There's a lot that I can do with this data:
1. Visualize daylight hours as a series, rather than a dataframe, to better see color difference between days
2. Plot daylight hours on a graph with a line of best fit with sunrise/sunset times
3. Mark solstices and equinoxes
